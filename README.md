# Magic-Sovereign
One of my first attempts to make an Game in Java. It was very difficult for me to create this game and the game is not finish and I was very embarrassed that I got only the character to walk and not more, but now (many years later) I looking back and find this project very nice. I was very unexperienced in that time and I see now the beauty of failure and learning in this project. My grade for this project was still a 1, because my teacher saw that I learned much during the project. There should be more teachers like him <3
